# Instructions
# In this exercise, we’ll refactor a DAG with a single overloaded task into a DAG with several tasks with well-defined boundaries
# 1 - Read through the DAG and identify points in the DAG that could be split apart
# 2 - Split the DAG into multiple tasks
# 3 - Run the DAG

# Remember to run "/opt/airflow/start.sh" command to start the web server. Once the Airflow web server is ready,  open the Airflow UI using the "Access Airflow" button. Turn your DAG “On”, and then Run your DAG. If you get stuck, you can take a look at the solution file in the workspace/airflow/dags folder in the workspace and the video walkthrough on the next page.
