    "## Exercise: Putting it All Together\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past few exercises, we have been exploring user clickstream data for an e-commerce website. In this example, we will pull our disparate data sources together. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this exercise, you will be able to see a summary, per user, of the total purchase and click amounts, in addition to the user's information. This kind of summary table is an important frequent type of analysis performed in e-commerce settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a table of user data and purchases, as well as a stream of click events\n",
    "\n",
    "In this table, we will tie together user information with their total number of clicks across all pages, as well as the total amount of their purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE users\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Build our aggregated output: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE user_activity AS\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    " upc.username,\n",
